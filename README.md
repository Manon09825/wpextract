Wiki Extract
============

Extract links from wikicode.
This code was built as part of L.Grobol's *Interfaces web* class in the second year of a Master's degree in NLP.

## How to use this
Install dependencies
``` bash
uv pip install -U -r requirements.lst
```

Run it (assuming `local/page.wiki` contains wikicode)
``` bash
python cli.py local/page.wiki
```
